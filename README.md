## Tasks

### Task 1

The task involves creating a simple C program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n. This was achieved using the following steps:

1. **Creating and Opening the File**:
    - The file `sum1ton.c` is created and opened using the vim editor.
     
    ```
        vim sum1ton.c
    ```

2. **Writing the Code**:
    - The code is written in the `sum1ton.c` file to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.

3. **Compiling and Running the Code**:
    - The code is compiled and run using the following commands:
    ```bash
    gcc sum1ton.c
    ./a.out
    ```
4. **Output**:

### Task 2
1. The parameter 'n' was changed from 5 to 100 in this task.

2. ```bash
   riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
   ls -ltr sum1ton.c
   ```
   This command is used to compile a C source file (sum1ton.c) into an object file (sum1ton.o) for the RISC-V 64-bit architecture. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of each part:
    - riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc: The compiler for the RISC-V 64-bit architecture.
    - O1: Optimization level 1, which provides a balance between compilation time and performance.
    - mabi=lp64: Specifies the ABI (Application Binary Interface) as lp64, meaning long and pointer data types are 64 bits.
    - march=rv64i: Specifies the target architecture as RISC-V 64-bit instruction set.

    ```bash
    riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
    ```
