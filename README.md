## Tasks

### Task 1

The task involves creating a simple C program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n. This was achieved using the following steps:

1. **Creating and Opening the File**:
    - The file `sum1ton.c` is created and opened using the vim editor.
     
    ```
        vim sum1ton.c
    ```

2. **Writing the Code**:
    - The code is written in the `sum1ton.c` file to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.

3. **Compiling and Running the Code**:
    - The code is compiled and run using the following commands:
    ```bash
    gcc sum1ton.c
    ./a.out
    ```
4. **Output**:
   - ![cat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1bcb790-f27e-4a80-b626-41b78a1413ff)

5. The parameter 'n' was changed from 5 to 100 in this task.

6. The following command is used to compile a C source file (sum1ton.c) into an object file (sum1ton.o) for the RISC-V 64-bit architecture. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of each part:
    ```bash
   riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
   ls -ltr sum1ton.c
   ```
    - riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc: The compiler for the RISC-V 64-bit architecture.
    - O1: Optimization level 1, which provides a balance between compilation time and performance.
    - mabi=lp64: Specifies the ABI (Application Binary Interface) as lp64, meaning long and pointer data types are 64 bits.
    - march=rv64i: Specifies the target architecture as RISC-V 64-bit instruction set.
  
   ![Output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bda4cd2a-ef57-43b8-80ba-6283a7a58b76)

    ```bash
    riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
    ```
    This displays a series of instructions along with their opcodes for the summation code. For this task, the "main" section was foused on and we navigated to the "main" section by typing ":/main" in the terminal.

    - From this we can observe that each instrucion is 4 bytes as successive instrucgtions have a diffrence of 4 bytes.
    - By subtracing the address of the last and the first instruction of the "main" section, and divinding by 4 we get 15 instructions. 

7. Similarly the same code was compiled using OFast optimization. 
    ```bash
   riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
   ls -ltr sum1ton.c
   ```
    ![12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cd49589-baca-47ec-88ea-0a78dda6e9f8)

   - Similarly here we get 12 instructions, 3 lesser than O1 optimization.
     
### Task 2
The code written in [Task 1](#task-1) is being debugged using the Spike simulator.

```bash
spike pk sum1ton.o
```
