## Tasks

### Task 1

The task involves creating a simple C program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n. This was achieved using the following steps:

1. **Creating and Opening the File**:
    - The file `sum1ton.c` is created and opened using the vim editor.
    ```bash
    vim sum1ton.c
    ```

2. **Writing the Code**:
    - The code is written in the `sum1ton.c` file to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.

3. **Compiling and Running the Code**:
    - The code is compiled and run using the following commands:
    ```bash
    gcc sum1ton.c
    ./a.out
    ```

4. **Output**:

5. **Parameter Change**:
    - The parameter 'n' was changed from 5 to 100 in this task.

6. **RISC-V Compilation**:
    - The following command is used to compile a C source file (sum1ton.c) into an object file (sum1ton.o) for the RISC-V 64-bit architecture.
    ```bash
    riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
    ls -ltr sum1ton.c
    ```

7. **Disassembling the Object File**:
    - Disassemble the object file to view the instructions.
    ```bash
    riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
    ```
    ![Disassembled Output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a05c12a-7e05-418f-aa5b-65f685dac8e5)
    - From this, we observe that each instruction is 4 bytes. By subtracting the address of the last instruction from the first and dividing by 4, we get 15 instructions for the main section.

8. **OFast Optimization**:
    - Similarly, the same code was compiled using OFast optimization.
    ```bash
    riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
    ls -ltr sum1ton.c
    ```
    ![OFast Output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cd49589-baca-47ec-88ea-0a78dda6e9f8)
    - Here, we get 12 instructions, 3 less than O1 optimization.

### Task 2

The code written in [Task 1](#task-1) is being debugged using the Spike simulator.

1. **Running the Code in Spike**:
    - The compiled object file is executed in the Spike simulator using the following command:
    ```bash
    spike pk sum1ton.o
    ```
    - This command loads the RISC-V program (`sum1ton.o`) and runs it in the Spike simulator environment.
    ![Spike Output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82ce5a0b-112a-4974-bb1f-6a8f38ebf090)

2. **Analyzing the Output**:
    - The output from the Spike simulator helps in verifying the correctness of the program execution on the RISC-V architecture.
    - In this case, it confirms that the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is calculated correctly.
